<remaining_work>
No code work remaining. Milestone-level steps:
1. Run /gsd:audit-milestone — verify cross-phase integration, E2E flows, requirement coverage
2. Run /gsd:complete-milestone — archive v2.2, update PROJECT.md
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
Key Phase 24 decisions (full list in STATE.md):
- VAPID public key client-exposed, private key server-only
- Device ID cookie (1-year) for multi-device subscription tracking
- PushProvider placed in Wave 1 (not Wave 2) because 24-02 settings page needs usePush()
- Fire-and-forget notification dispatch (.catch pattern) to avoid blocking API responses
- Supabase Realtime for instant in-app notification delivery
- Entity grouping in notification dropdown (e.g., "WO #42 - 3 Updates")
- Badge count capped at 9+ standard pattern
</decisions_made>

All REQUIREMENTS.md entries for PUSH-01 through PUSH-12 are marked Complete. ROADMAP.md shows all phases complete. STATE.md shows 100% progress.

Known UAT items deferred (not blocking):
- Invoice linking modal UI (uses prompt() currently)
- Property-level delivery history page
- Checklist item title lookup from template
