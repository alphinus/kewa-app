## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 13: Partner-Modul

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Missing VERIFICATION.md | Low | Plans executed successfully, formal verification not recorded |

### Phase 16: Template-Management

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Alert stub on "Template anwenden" button | Info | Cosmetic - actual flow works via unit detail page |

### Phase 17: Admin & Onboarding

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Missing VERIFICATION.md | Low | Plans executed successfully, formal verification not recorded |

### Total Tech Debt

- **2 missing verification files** (process debt, not functional)
- **1 cosmetic stub** (non-blocking)

## Conclusion

**v2.1 Milestone Status: TECH_DEBT**

All functional requirements are met. All phases executed successfully. Cross-phase integration verified. E2E flows complete.

The only tech debt is process-related:
- Phases 13 and 17 were executed without formal VERIFICATION.md generation
- This is documentation debt, not functional debt
- The integration checker has verified these phases work correctly

**Recommendation:** Accept tech debt and proceed to milestone completion. The missing verification files can be generated post-hoc if desired, but are not blocking deployment.
