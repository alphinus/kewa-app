## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 13 | Email required for contractors, optional for suppliers | Contractors need email for work order notifications |
| 13 | Trade filtering fallback shows all partners | Prevents empty dropdown when trades don't match |
| 14 | BuildingContext with 'all' option | Support global view with explicit selection |
| 14 | Client-side building filter via unit relation | Supabase nested filtering limitation |
| 15 | Room condition managed by Digital Twin | Automation over manual editing |
| 16 | Template-first project creation flow | Matches KEWA renovation workflow |
| 16 | Drag-drop within parent only | Prevents accidental structure changes |
| 17 | Setup wizard on first login | Guided onboarding for new deployments |

**Issues Resolved:**
- Partner dropdown in WorkOrderForm now filters by trade category
- Building context properly wired to all data pages
- Template list shows phase counts and modification dates
- First-time users guided through initial setup

**Issues Deferred:**
- EXT-15: Automatic reminders (requires background job infrastructure)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Phases 13 and 17 missing formal VERIFICATION.md files (process debt)
- Alert stub on template detail "Template anwenden" button (cosmetic)
